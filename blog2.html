            For this second blog post I will talk about zooming in on an image when you hover it
            with a mouse. This is mainly based on CSS editing of the scale.

        This link -->
        <a href="https://dev.to/duomly/12-amazing-css-tips-and-tricks-you-should-know-4anf">CSS TIPS #9</a>
        shows a lot of tips and tricks, but I decided to choose number 9 which is about zooming in on 
        an image when you hover it. I got the code below from the site and the main function of making
        the zoom work is transform: scale(1.3) and by changing that number you can change how much it zooms.
        </p>
            <p>
                .images {<br>
                    display: flex;<br>
                    width: 100vw;<br>
                    juftify-content: center;<br>
                    align-items: center;
                  }<br>
                  <br>
                  img {
                    width: 400px;
                  }<br>
                  <br>
                  img:hover {
                    transform: scale(1.3);
                  }
            </p>
        <p>
            I believe this would be useful because people would like to see a zoomed in type
            of picture if it is kind of small. By hovering without zooming in with your mouse
            all you got to do is hover and everything is already done for you already.
