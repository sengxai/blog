            For this third blog post I will be talking about responsive web design.
            It is about when you resize your screen the content changes with it as well.
            This would be great for different device sizes such as desktop browser and 
            mobile browsers.
        </p>

        <h2>Example Below</h2>
        <p>
            body{<br>
            color: red;<br>
        }<br>
        @media (max-width: 800px){<br>
            body{<br>
            color: blue;}<br>
        }<br>
        @media (max-width: 500px){<br>
        body{<br>
        color: green;}<br>
        }

        </p>

        <p>
            The body color text is red and when we resize it to
            800 px the text changes to blue. When we resize the browser
            to be 500px then it would change to the color blue.
            By applying this concept we could use this to change pictures or text on how
            they appear on different screen sizes.
