        <p>For this blog post it will be about pagination. This would be good for blog
            postings and navigating to the most recent or latest ones. Just by adding a
            few lines of code into the CSS stylesheet.
        </p>

        <p>
            .pagination {<br>
                display: inline-block;<br>
              }<br>
              <br>
              .pagination a {<br>
                color: black;<br>
                float: left;<br>
                padding: 8px 16px;<br>
                text-decoration: none;<br>
              }<br>
              
        </p>

        <p>
            We would have to have to have href to whatever link or page that we have setup.
            With each and everyone of that we could name the page names to be like 1, 2, 3... etc.
            the .pagination a modifies how the text would look like in the pagination with hyperlink.
            While in .pagination all it does is just displays how the pagination would look like.
